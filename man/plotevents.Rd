\usage{
plotevents(simObj, meta)
}
\arguments{
\item{simObj}{a fsc object created with strataG tools}

\item{meta}{Metadata associated with the demes in the simulation.}
}
\value{
A plot visualizing the migration events over time.
}
\description{
This function visualizes migration events over time between different demes based on a simulation object.
}
\details{
The function creates a plot with demes on the x-axis and time on the y-axis. Arrows indicate migration 
events between demes, with the direction of the arrow pointing from the source deme to the sink deme. 
The color of the arrow is determined by the source of the migration event, and the y-position indicates 
the time at which the migration event took place.

The time axis is transformed using a logarithmic scale for better visualization.
